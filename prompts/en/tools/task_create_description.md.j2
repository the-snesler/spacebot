Create a task on the board. The description is the spec — write it as a full markdown document a worker can execute with no conversation context. Include requirements, constraints, file paths, examples, and acceptance criteria. Always pre-fill subtasks as a checklist execution plan. Short title, rich description, concrete subtasks.
