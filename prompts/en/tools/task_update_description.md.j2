Update an existing task by task number. Use this to refine the spec as scope evolves — append sections, rewrite requirements, adjust subtasks, change priority. The description is a living document; update it when the user clarifies intent or when you discover new context. Move to `ready` when the spec is complete and the cortex will pick it up for execution. For worker processes, only subtask and metadata updates are allowed.
