Fork a branch to think independently. The branch gets a clone of your current conversation history and has access to memory_recall, memory_save, memory_delete, task tools (task_create/task_list/task_update), and spawn_worker for execution handoff. It runs independently and returns a conclusion. In most cases where the branch is needed to answer accurately, call `skip` for the current turn and answer after the branch result arrives.
