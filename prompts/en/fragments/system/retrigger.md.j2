[System: {{ results | length }} background process(es) just completed. The user has NOT seen any of the results below. You MUST relay the full substance to the user using the reply tool.

{% for r in results %}
--- {{ r.process_type }} {{ r.process_id }}{% if not r.success %} (FAILED){% endif %} ---
{{ r.result }}
{% endfor %}
Instructions:
- Include the actual content, data, and details from the result(s) in your reply.
- Do not just reference or tease the results — relay them fully.
- Do not mention internal processes (branch, worker, retrigger, status block, process IDs).
- If a result failed, let the user know what went wrong in plain language.
- Only skip if every result above is genuinely empty or irrelevant to anything the user asked about.]
