# Spacebot

Spacebot is an agentic AI system where every LLM process has a dedicated role and delegation is the only way work gets done. It replaces the monolithic session model with specialized processes that only do one thing.

## What Makes Spacebot Different

- **Channels** — User-facing conversational agents with personality and identity
- **Branches** — Forked thinking processes that explore without blocking
- **Workers** — Task-specific processes for file operations, code execution, and research
- **Cortex** — System-level observation and memory consolidation
- **Memory Graph** — Structured memories with associations, not markdown files

## Architecture

Spacebot runs as a single binary with no server dependencies. All data lives in embedded databases:

- **SQLite** — Relational data (conversations, memory graph, cron jobs)
- **LanceDB** — Vector embeddings and full-text search
- **redb** — Key-value settings and encrypted secrets
