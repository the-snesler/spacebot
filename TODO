  ☐ Force branching before response

Cortex Loops:
  ☐ Check tasks + elevate todos
  ☐ Improve bulletin
  ☐ Better cortex loop context

Improvements:
  ☐ Improve cron
  ☐ Named adapters
  ☐ Thread names should be better, match channel name style

Live Data Sources (maybe not needed):
  ☐ Repos
  ☐ Documentation

Features:
  ☐ Agent creation flow / onboarding UI
  ☐ Cortex chat context inspection — should be able to read the full channel context at any time
  ☐ Add streaming support

Urgent:
  ☐ Send customer emails ASAP

Settings:
  ☐ Disable sandboxing / sandbox settings

Notes:
  Testing inter-agent comms: send a message to the Spacebot Tech Lead, who forwards to the Community Manager, who picks a random word relating to fruit, technology, or space exploration, sending it back up the chain.
